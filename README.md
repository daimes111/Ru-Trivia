# Ru-Trivia

Ru-Trivia is a trivia game where players get to test their knowledge about the show Ru Paul's drag race. 
----How to Play----
There are three difficutly settings the player choses from. Easy mode is a true false questionnaire, medium mode is a multiple choice, and hard is a timed multiple choice with more advance questions.

Players must submit an answer to go to the next question in the easy and the medium mode. 

In hard mode, if players do not answer within the correct time frame, it counts as an incorrect answer and goes to the next question.

If you get three incorrect guess in any game, the game is over and you do not get to save your score.

Easy setting will show feedback on the question to help the player more about the show so the timeout delay is a little longer. 
----Why I chose Ru-Trivia----
I love drag queen performances and started watching RuPaul's Drag Race with friends in Denver, CO with local drag competition that followed. My friend knew all of the competitiors so I got to get really involved with the local drag. 
Fast forward many years later and I still love to watch the show with friends and actually met my partner because of it. 
I love when I'm really good at trivia, so it was fun to create a game that I knew that I would be good at hahahahaha :)
